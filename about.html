      <h1 id="skip">About Me</h1>
      <p>Bridging the fields of anthropology, computer-supported cooperative work
        (CSCW), and ICTD (Information Communication Technologies & Development),
         I use qualitative methods to study how underrepresented groups collaboratively
         access and participate with information communication technologies
         (ICTs) in politically and resource-constrained societies. Drawing on my
         training as a sociocultural anthropologist, my work investigates (1)
         internet access in resource-constrained regions; (2) the design of
         citizen-led information systems; and (3) social media use for social change. <br> <br>

        I received my Ph.D. in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.
        My dissertation analyzed how individuals in Havana, Cuba, collaboratively
        piece together multiple information infrastructures to create a uniquely “Cuban”
        internet against the backdrop of prohibitive access to the world wide web. <br> <br>

        At Georgia Tech, I was advised by
        <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Amy.Bruckman/" target="_blank"> Amy Bruckman </a>
        and <a href="https://www.nehakumar.org/" target="blank">Neha Kumar</a> and was a
        member of the <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/elc/" target="blank">ELC Lab</a>
        and the <a href="https://tandemlab.tech/" target="blank">TanDem Lab</a>.
        I am also a Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellow. <br><br>

        I have a Master’s degree in anthropology from Georgia State University,
        specializing in cultural and digital anthropology. My
        <a href="https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/52/" target="blank">research</a> examined
        the use of Facebook for impression management and political activism by
        diasporic Hispanic groups. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Spanish
        from the University of Georgia, where my studies centered on Spanish
        media and culture.<br><br>

        In between getting my degrees, I worked as a social media and public
        relations manager at organizations including Georgia Tech, Georgia
        Aquarium, Northside Hospital, and Cohen Wolfe. I’ve also worked as a
        private social media consultant for individuals, non-profits, and small
        businesses. <br><br>

        I enjoy collaborating with researchers across a variety of disciplines
        to examine engagements with digital technologies among traditionally
        underrepresented groups. I am particularly interested in qualitative
        research methods, social computing, HCI4D, information communication
        technologies and development (ICTD), internet access interventions,
        hyper-local information infrastructures, e-democracy, activism through
        social media, and the virtual public sphere. <br><br>

        I also enjoy exploring remote places, throwing impromptu dance parties,
        reading historical fiction, and playing with all kinds of animals. <br> <br>
